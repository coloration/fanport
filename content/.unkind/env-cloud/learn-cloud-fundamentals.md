## Foundational & Compute Service 

### What's Cloud Computing

#### Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet. The cloud is like a virtual data center accessible via the Internet that allows you to manage:

- Storage services likes databases
- Servers, compute power, networking
- Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
- Security services for data and applications

#### Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- Pay as you go - You pay only for what you use and only when your code runs.
- Autoscaling - The number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.
- Serverless - Allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

### Types of Cloud Computing

1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS)
  - The provider supplies virtual server instances, storage, and mechanisms for you to manage servers.
  - e.g. AWS(Amazon Web Services), Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Iron Mountain

2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
  - A platform of development tools hosted on a provider's infrastructure. Provider manage the hardware and operating system. Developer focus on managing and deploying applications.
  - e.g. GoDaddy, salesforcesforce.com
3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
  A software application that runs over the Internet and is managed by the service provider.
  - e.g. Google's Gmail, Microsoft's Office 365

### Cloud Computing Deployment Model

- Public Cloud
  - A public cloud makes resources available over the Internet to the general public.
  - Resources include databases, application development services, etc.
- Private Cloud
  - A private cloud is a proprietary network that supplies services to a limited number of people.
- Hybrid Cloud
  - A hybrid model contains a combination of both a public and a private cloud.
  - The hybrid model is a growing trend in the industry for those organizations that have been slow to adopt the cloud due to being in a heavily regulated industry. The hybrid model gives organizations the flexibility to slowly migrate to the cloud.
